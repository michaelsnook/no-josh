          President Biden did the right thing by dropping out. Aside from his
          health concerns, his record on international and economic issues has
          left much to be desired.

          Vice President Harris will assuredly be the new nominee, and now she
          needs to gain the trust of working-class, progressive, and young
          voters. She can start by committing to support an immediate and
          permanent ceasefire in Gaza and an end to the illegal occupation of
          Palestine. Israel is conducting an ongoing genocide and we must do
          everything in our power to stop it. Harris must also commit to
          following American and international law by ending illegal weapons
          sales to Israel as well as increasing the amount of foreign aid going
          into Gaza and the West Bank.

          But winning back the trust of disaffected voters doesn&rsquo;t end
          with replacing the top of the ticket. Selecting a Vice Presidential
          nominee with anti-Palestinian and pro-war views will depress turnout
          among Muslim, Arab-American, and young voters, and greatly reduce the
          excitement that comes with a new nominee. Additionally, the new
          Democratic ticket must strongly support labor&rsquo;s right to
          organize, adequate funding and oversight of public schools, a
          functional and humane immigration system, and robust protections for
          queer and reproductive rights. A VP nominee who has failed to support
          the rights of workers and immigrants, diverted public education
          funding toward for-profit entities, or restricted access to
          reproductive or gender-affirming care would risk losing the support of
          millions of working-class voters, including those in swing states
          crucial to securing victory. To that end, Kamala Harris and her VP
          nominee must also affirm their support for President Biden&rsquo;s
          recently announced plans to offer relief for working-class Americans
          struggling with the high costs of education, housing, healthcare, and
          childcare.

          The left must unite over the next four weeks to ensure that America
          doesn&rsquo;t fall down the path of fascism, authoritarianism, and
          runaway corporatism. It is in Harris&apos;s and the Democrats&apos;
          best interests to listen to their base and ensure that both their new
          VP pick and their platform support the majority of Democrats and
          Americans who want social and economic justice for workers and an
          immediate ceasefire in Palestine.
